V0.001: [ Unknwn<9d ] : [ Unkwnc ( commits ) ] : Github domain Aquired; HTML-Website loads.

V0.002: [ Unknwn<7d ] : [ Unkwnc ] : Letters written; re-learning HTML.

V0.003: [ Unknwn<5d ] : [ Unkwnc ] : Colors, again. Made css file.

V0.004: [ Unknwn<5d ] : [ Unkwnc ] : Fonts are working; used Google-font sourced free domain font. Name; Spectral. Might change to different one; thinking a monospaced serif?

V0.005: [ 2-19-2024 ] : [ 00118c ] : READING FROM .txt FILES IS A GO! Took an overnight; MAN, I feel dumb. Guess that shows how much more I need to practice ( lmao )! Absolute Credit to Rajdeep Singh from [ https://officialrajdeepsingh.dev ]! My final function ( as of writing, will add argument passing & such later ) was based-off of his! It's suprising how many tutorials use deprecated info? Or maybe, I'm just unlucky? ...something tells me that's the case.
        Whatever! Thanks, Singh!!!

Next; 
      - Tables, 
      - Custom-backgrounds/gif-backgorunds, 
      - Expand quick file-read function,
      - Move all JS to seperate file and read from there ( I fundementally understand, but still dislike in-html's bulk when padded by scripts. ),
      - Actually switch out the font we're using for a Monospaced one!! Spectral looks nice, but man, it's... hm.
      - Make/Update relevent social medias
      -   - Links to such, embed them!
      -   - Update Resume and add download link
